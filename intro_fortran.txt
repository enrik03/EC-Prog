!Purpose: This module load the initial input paraeters and the initial data 
!needed for transport calculations. The parameter are divide into the system
!parameters and electronic parameters respectivelly. This module use the 
!Tag's [1] suroutines defined in the module UTILITIES in order to facilitate 
!the redin of the input parameters, and also external LAPACK [2] subroutines
!for solve the inversion and eigen proplem of a matrix.
!
!(i)the system parameters: the name of the project (DNA or PROTEIN),the number of 
!levels (NL) for the reduce matrix, the number of monomers (NM),i.e. number of 
!nucleotides or amino acids in the sequence,the number of actual pair (NAM) in the sequence,
!the zise (LH) of the Hamiltonian matrix of each pair,the HOMO's position (HOMO1,HOMO2)
! in the Fock matrix of the fragment the length of the system (NS),i.e. the number of 
!different combination of the monomers; 
!(ii)Electronic parameters: elctronic temperature (Tp),the lead (Lead), the Fermi level
!of the lead (Ef),the chemical potentials (MuL,MuR),the scape rate (Gm),and the DC 
!applied voltage (DC_volt)
!
!The data for he system is stored inthe follows array: 
!a)the 1D SeqM, CouplM and ActPairM arrays stored the sequencen, the coupling and the 
!number of actual pair of monomers.
  
!b)the 1D arrays ListSyst and ListOrd stored in a list the monomers members of the project, 
!and the number and defined order in which the data is stored

!c)the 1D arrays ListLH, ListHOM1 and ListHOM2; stored the zise of the Fock matirx and the
!position in the Fock matrix of the HOMO's of fragments for each pairs of monomers(*)

!d)the array ListLev, accordin with the number of level NL and the HOMO's position, stored
!the set of levels of each fragment to be used in the construction of the reduce matrix,
!i.e. stored ......HOMO1-1,HOMO1,LUMO1,......HOMO2-1,HOMO2,LUMO2, of each pair(*)
!
!e)the arrays ListH0,ListS and ListH; stored the isolated Hamiltonian (of fragments)matrix,
!the overlap matrix and the coupling Hamiltonian (fragments + ending groups) matirx of each 
!pair of monomers(*)
!
!f)The arrays ListH0Red and ListSRed, stored the reduce isolated hamitonian of fragments and 
!overlap matrix for ecah pairs according to the set of levels stored in ListLev(*)
!
!g)the arrays ListEva and ListEve, stored the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian
!matrix (generalize eigen problem) of each pair(*)
!
!h)The arrays ListEveRed stored the reduce set of eigenvector for ecah pairs, according to the 
!set of levels stored in ListLev(*)
!
!Finally a set of constant needed for calculations are defined: the value of Pi, the electon
!charge(Ech), the Plank constant(Hp),the Boltzman constant(Kb), and a conversion factor(CF)(**)
!
!
!Note:
!(*)All stored follows the order defined in ListOrd
!(**)In Hartree units
!NMAX define the maximum zise allocation for the H0,S,H, Eve,Eva, matrices, since pairs all
!different in zise
!H0 is a temporal array for intermediate calculations of isolated Hamiltonian
